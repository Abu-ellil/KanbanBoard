# Kanban Board JavaScript Project

This is a Kanban board project built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The Kanban board is a tool for visualizing tasks and workflow, and my implementation allows users to easily add, edit, and move tasks between columns.
##UPDATE 
You can now add tasks by your voice.
